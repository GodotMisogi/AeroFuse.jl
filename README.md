## Airfoil Parametrization

AeroMDAO provides some basic parametrizations commonly used for airfoils, with conversion to the camber-thickness representation and vice versa.

*NACA 4-digit Airfoil Parametrization*

```julia
naca4(digits :: NTuple{4, Real})
```

```julia
airfoil = naca4((2,4,1,2))
```

*Kulfan Class Shape Transformation (CST) Method*
```julia
kulfan_CST(alpha_u		:: Vector{Real},	# Upper surface parameters
		   alpha_l		:: Vector{Real},	# Lower surface parameters
		   dzs			:: NTuple{2, Real},	# Upper and lower trailing edge points
		   coeff_LE = 0	:: Real,			# Leading-edge modification coefficient
		   n = 40		:: Integer)			# Number of points on each surface
```

```julia
alpha_u = [0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.2]
alpha_l = [-0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.001, -0.02]
dzs = (1e-4, 1e-4)
foil = kulfan_CST(alpha_u, alpha_l, dzs, 0.2)
```

*Camber-Thickness Representation*
```julia
foil_camthick(coords	:: Array{2, Real},	# 2D coordinates
			  num = 40	:: Integer)			# Number of points for distributions 
```

```julia
foilpath = "path/to/your/airfoil.dat"   # Airfoil coordinates file path
coords = read_foil(foilpath)            # Read coordinates file
cos_foil = cosine_foil(coords, 51)      # Cosine spacing with 51 points on upper and lower surfaces
xcamthick = foil_camthick(cos_foil)     # Convert to camber-thickness representation
foiler = camthick_foil(xcamthick[:,1],	# x-components
					   xcamthick[:,2],	# Camber distribution
					   xcamthick[:,3])	# Thickness distribution
```

## Doublet-Source Panel Method

AeroMDAO provides convenience functions using its specific types for analyses.

The `Foil` type converts the coordinates into a friendly type for analyses. 

```julia
airfoil = naca4((2,4,1,2))
foil = Foil(airfoil)
```

The `Uniform2D` type consists of the freestream speed and angle of attack. 

```julia
V, α = 1.0, 3.0 
uniform = Uniform2D(V, α)
```

To analyse this foil with these boundary conditions using the incompressible 2D doublet-source panel method, the following method is called. Optional named arguments are provided to specify whether the source terms are non-zero, the length of the wake, and the number of panels for the analysis.

```julia
solve_case(foil					:: Foil
		   uniform				:: Uniform2D;
		   sources = false		:: Bool,
		   wake_length = 1e3	:: Float,
		   num_panels = 60		:: Integer)
```

The method returns the lift coefficient calculated by the doublet strength of the wake panel, the lift and pressure coefficients over the panels, and the panels generated for post-processing.

```julia
cl, cls, cps, panels = solve_case(airfoil,
								  uniform;
								  sources = false,
								  wake_length = 1e3,
								  num_panels = 80)
```

## Wing Parametrization

The following image depicts the parametrization schema used for wing planforms in terms of nested trapezoids.

![](https://godot-bloggy.xyz/post/diagrams/WingGeometry.svg)

This parametrization is implemented as a composite type called a `HalfWing`.

```julia
HalfWing(foils		:: Vector{Foil},	# Foil profiles
		 chords		:: Vector{Real},	# Chord lengths
		 twists		:: Vector{Real},	# Twist angles (deg)
		 spans		:: Vector{Real},	# Section span lengths
		 dihedrals	:: Vector{Real},	# Dihedral angles (deg)
		 sweeps		:: Vector{Real})	# Leading-edge sweep angles (deg)
```

We can create a `Wing` by feeding two `HalfWing`s to it.

```julia
Wing(left	:: HalfWing,	# Left side
	 right	:: HalfWing)	# Right side
```

```julia
airfoil = naca4((2,4,1,2))
foils = Foil.(airfoil for i in 1:3)
wing_right = HalfWing(foils,
					[0.4, 0.2, 0.1],
					[0., 2., 5.],
					[1.0, 0.1],
					[0., 60.],
					[0., 30.])

wing = Wing(wing_right, wing_right)
```

We can obtain the relevant geometric information of the wing for design analyses by calling convenience methods, which automatically perform the necessary calculations on the nested trapezoidal planforms.

```julia
span(wing), projected_area(wing), mean_aerodynamic_chord(wing), aspect_ratio(wing)
```

You can access each side of a `Wing` by calling either `wing.left` or `wing.right`, and the previous functions should work identically on these `HalfWing`s.

## Vortex Lattice Method

To run a vortex lattice analysis on a `Wing`, we first define a `Freestream` object consisting of the boundary conditions for the analyses, parametrised by the freestream speed `V`, angle of attack `α`, side-slip angle `β`, and a quasi-steady rotation vector `Ω`. We also specify the density and reference location for calculating moments generated by the forces.

```julia
U = 10.0
α = 5.0
β = 0.0
Ω = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

freestream = Freestream(U, α, β, Ω);

ρ = 1.225
r_ref = [0.25 * mean_aerodynamic_chord(wing), 0., 0.]
```

Now we run the case with specifications of the number of spanwise and chordwise panels by calling the `solve_case()` function, which has an associated method.
```julia
solve_case(wing 					:: Union{Wing, HalfWing},
		   freestream 				:: Freestream,
		   ρ 						:: Real,
		   r_ref = [0.25, 0., 0.] 	:: Vector{Real};
		   span_num = 5 			:: Integer,
		   chord_num = 10			:: Integer)
```

The method uses the planform of the wing to compute the horseshoe elements, and the camber distribution to compute the normal vectors for the analyses.

It returns the nearfield and farfield coefficients, the non-dimensionalised forces and moments over the panels, the panels used for the horseshoe elements, the camber panels, the horseshoe elements used for plotting streamlines, and the associated vortex strengths `Γs` corresponding to the solution of the system.
```julia
nf_coeffs, ff_coeffs, CFs, CMs, horseshoe_panels, camber_panels, horseshoes, Γs = 
	solve_case(wing, freestream, ρ, r_ref; span_num = 10, chord_num = 10) 
```

See the `examples` folder for plotting, which currently uses the `Plots` module with `plotlyjs()`.
